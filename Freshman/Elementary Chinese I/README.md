## ABOUT HOMEWORKS

Homeworks are different from one teacher to another, but it is mainly about writing and pronunciation. 
So I can not provide information about it.
However, if you want to improve your chinese I suggest to buy the "Intensive Chinese for Pre-university students" by the Beijing language and culture university press. 
Unless you take a full year Chinese program and practice everyday, you won't be able to speak Chinese or understand properly.
